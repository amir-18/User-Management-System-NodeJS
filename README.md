User Management App
Hey! This is a simple project I built to learn how to handle data with Express.js and MongoDB. It’s a full CRUD app, meaning you can create, read, update, and delete users. I also used Tailwind CSS to give it a nice dark-mode look.

What it does
Dashboard: Shows all users in a clean list.

Create: Add new users with a name and an image URL.

Edit/Delete: Easily update user info or remove them from the database.

Database: Uses Mongoose to talk to MongoDB.

Tech Stack
Backend: Express.js & Node.js

Database: MongoDB

Frontend: EJS & Tailwind CSS

🚀 How to run it
Download the code: Grab the files from this repo.

Install dependencies: Open your terminal in the project folder and run:
npm install
(This will download Express and Mongoose for you).

Start your DB: Make sure your local MongoDB is running.

Launch: Run the app using:

node app.js
